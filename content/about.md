Experience
----------

**R&D Engineer internship:**  InterDigital (Rennes)

AI-driven robot from simulators to real world.

*  Implementation of an intelligent robotic system composed mainly of a manipulator arm UR3e and a mobile robot turtlebot 3 (ROS / GAZEBO).
* The selection of a physical simulator for robotic learning. Ensuring a smooth transition from simulation to reality.
* Positioning of the UR3e end effector using reinforcement learning algorithms (DDPG-TD3-SAC).
* Mobile navigation with obstacle avoidance using a reinforcement learning approach (Q-Learning - DQN...)

**R&D Engineer internship:**

Dynamic simulation of a collaborative industsrial robot's stoppage inside a secure workcell.

*  Safety standards for collaborative robots.
*  State of the art of dynamic identification methods. 
*  Parameters identification of ABB IRB 6640 et ABB IRB 2600 robots dynamics.
*  Dynamic simulation of the robot collision as per SSM Safety configuration.
*  Detection and motion tracking of the operator using depth camera.
